        <h2>About the Artist</h2>
        <p>
          Hi! I'm Dyanna, a non-binary artist based in Atlanta. Though I’ve been
          creating art for many years, I only recently began sharing my work
          online. My primary mediums are digital illustration and linocut
          printing, but I also explore watercolor, gouache, and acrylic.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work spans a diverse range of topics, tones, styles, and subjects.
          A common thread throughout my pieces is a meticulous attention to
          detail and a vibrant use of color. I strive to bring movement and life
          into every artwork, drawing inspiration from the world around me.
        </p>

          Launched in the fall of 2023, Peach Butter Prints represents the
          culmination of years of dedication and refinement. Since then, I’ve
          had the pleasure of participating in various Atlanta fairs, where my
          work has been warmly received. I'm thrilled to share my art with a
          broader audience and and continue growing within my local community.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for joining me on this creative journey – I look forward to
          what the future holds!
